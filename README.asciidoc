Binary Object Notation,
A.K.A. Beeno Object Notation

Based on stackish.

== Introduction ==

This protocol and library is designed to enable loss-less data exchange between Erlang to Javascript.

Loss-less means it will not mess up tuple and list, nor atom and hashmap key

* Integer is represented in dec format, e.g. 42

* Floating number is represented in rational format (of integer), e.g. 314/100

== Remark ==

(For ideal performance, consider to use https://github.com/beenotung/erlang_js[@beenotung/erlang_js] which use Erlang External Term Format directly)

== The Mapping between Erlang term, BON and Javascript term ==

.Data Type Mapping Table

== TODO ==
. Migrate the repo from personal to org
  - [x] move js to bon-js
  - [x] move erl to bon-erl
  - [x] add links to implementation (library) in readme
. Implement in more programming langauges
  - [ ] Golang
  - [ ] Java
